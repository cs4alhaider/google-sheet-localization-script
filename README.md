## Main function in Code.gs
```js
/**
 * Fetch the the sheet and start creating root folder and sub folders for each lang with Localization.strings file
 *
 */
function exportLocalizationsFiles() {
  var startDate = new Date();
  Logger.log('ðŸ—‚ Starting exporting localization files, time: ' + startDate.toString());
  
  var app = SpreadsheetApp;
  var spreadsheet = app.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName('Localizable');

  
  var columnsCount = sheet.getRange('A:AF').getNumColumns() ;
  var locations = [...Array(columnsCount).keys()].map(column => columnToLetter(column + 1));
  
  var languages = sheet.getRange(locations[0] + '1:' + locations[locations.length - 1] + '1').getValues()[0];
  var languageCodes = languages.map(value => value.substring(value.lastIndexOf("(") + 1, value.lastIndexOf(")")))
      
  Logger.log("languageCodes == locations => " + (languageCodes.length == locations.length));

  var rootFolderName = 'Localization Files - ' + startDate.toString();
  var rootFolder = DriveApp.createFolder(rootFolderName);
  var rootFolderURL = rootFolder.getUrl();

  Logger.log('ðŸ‘‰ Created root folder with name: ' + rootFolderName + '\nðŸ‘‰ Root folder URL => ' + rootFolderURL);

  for(index = 0; index < locations.length; index++) {
    var range = locations[index] + '2:' + locations[index] + '150';
    var fileContent = sheet.getRange(range).getValues().join('\n\n');
    var subFolder = rootFolder.createFolder(languageCodes[index] + '.lproj');

    Logger.log('Created folder for ' + languageCodes[index].toUpperCase());

    subFolder.createFile('Localizable.strings', fileContent);

    Logger.log('Remaining is ' + ((locations.length - 1) - index) + '...');
  }

  var endDate = new Date();
  var timeDiff = startDate.getSeconds() + endDate.getSeconds();

  Logger.log('âœ… DONE in : ' + timeDiff.toString() + ' second' + ', folder URL ==> ' + rootFolderURL);
}
```
